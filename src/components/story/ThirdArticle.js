                I like to consistently challenge myself rather than remain in a
                comfort zone. For instance, I once accepted an opportunity to
                work at Elevenia, SK planetâ€™s global subsidiary in Indonesia, as
                a Frontend Developer. I was able to adapt to the new environment
                quickly by becoming friends with colleagues and learning more
                about the culture quickly. My friendly personality helped me to
                communicate well. As a result, I could design and develop new
                functions to the global e-commerce site successfully.
